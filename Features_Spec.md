# TaxPadi: Features 2 & 3 Specification

## Feature 2: Tax Forecast & Planner
**Goal:** Visualize tax liability as a monthly savings goal and set reminders.

### A. The "Safe" Amount Logic
* **Input:** `Total Annual Tax` (from Calculator).
* **Calculation:** `Monthly Savings Target` = `Total Annual Tax` / 12.
* **Display:** Show the "Monthly Savings Target" prominently.
* **UI Component:** A "Scoreboard" card that says:
    * "You owe ₦[Amount] in taxes this year."
    * "To be safe, save ₦[Amount] every month."
    * **Action Button:** "I have saved this month" (Clicking this toggles a simple "Saved" checkmark for the current month - store in LocalStorage).

### B. Reminder System (Calendar Integration)
* Since we cannot send server push notifications in this MVP, we will generate a Calendar Event file (.ics) for the user to download.
* **Event 1 (Recurring):** "TaxPadi: Monthly Tax Savings"
    * Date: 25th of every month (Salary week).
* **Event 2 (One-off):** "TaxPadi: Filing Deadline"
    * Date: March 31st.
* **Action:** Add a button "Add Reminders to Calendar".
