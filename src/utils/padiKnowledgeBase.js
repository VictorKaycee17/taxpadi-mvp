        response: `Nigeria uses a progressive tax system with 6 bands:

• First ₦800,000: 0% (Tax Free! 🎉)
• Next ₦2.2M: 15%
• Next ₦9M: 18%
• Next ₦13M: 21%
• Next ₦25M: 23%

    {
        keywords: ['rent', 'rent relief', 'housing'],
        response: `You can claim Rent Relief under the 2025 Tax Act!

✅ How it works:
• Claim 20% of your annual rent
• Maximum cap: ₦500,000

Example: If your annual rent is ₦3,000,000:
• 20% = ₦600,000
• But you can only claim ₦500,000 (the cap)

This reduces your taxable income!`

💰 **Tax-Deductible Contributions:**
• Pension: Usually 8% of your salary
• NHF (National Housing Fund): 2.5% of basic salary
• NHIS: Health insurance premiums

All of these are subtracted from your gross income before calculating tax.`

5️⃣ Apply progressive tax bands
6️⃣ = Total Tax

The TaxPadi calculator does all this automatically! Just enter your details and click Calculate Tax. 😊`

❌ Old: CRA (₦200k + 20% of gross)
✅ New: 
• ₦800,000 tax-free threshold
